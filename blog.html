        <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
        <h1>In JavaScript, DOM is actually a class that makes it really easy to define each element present within a web
            page so it
            can be modified later. Whenever a page is loaded in the browser, its document object is formed that is named
            as
            "document". The Document Object Model (DOM) aims to make it easier for Javascript to access HTML elements.
            DOM plays a rather very important role in website performance. For example, let's say you are visiting a
            website and logging into your account. After logging in, you will be greeted by the website, for example,
            'Hello <name>' along with your username, profile picture, etc.

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-3">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
        </h1>
        <h1> Most general way to manipulate html with dom is, Use the dom methods and put the class/id/tagname in dom
            methods. Like if we want to access an input field given id="input-field" we have to write
            document.getElementById('input-field').value to catch the element value, There are more methods of DOm
            below. <br>
            <span class="font-bold">DOM Methods:</span> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>innerHTML: It is used to access & write content inside HTML elements</li>
                <li>innerText: It is used to access the text content of a node and its descendants</li>
                <li>getElementById(): Access of an element using specific Id.</li>
                <li>getElementsByClassName():It returns a collection of all objects which match the specified class in
                    the method.</li>
                <li>getElementsByName(): Returns a NodeList of objects which match a particular name attribute in the
                    HTML document</li>
                <li>getElementsByTagName(): Gives back objects which match a tag name in the HTML document</li>
                <li>querySelector(): </li>
                <li>querySelectorAll(): With this selector, It returns NodeList of all elements that are found within
                    the HTML.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-3">3. What is event bubble?</h1>
        <h1>Event Bubbling in Javascript describe in which order some nested elements receive a given event.The
            principle of bubbling is simple. Whenever an event occurs on an element, at first place it will run the
            handler on
            it, then its parent, then on other ancestors.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-3">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
        <h1>A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.

            A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that
            it can be
            executed in that other function is called as a callback function. In our event handler section we put the
            callback function so it can do the work inside and return the value to the following element where it will
            work upon.</h1>
